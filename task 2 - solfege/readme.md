This Python script contains two functions: `she_says_he_says` and `solfege`.

## she_says_he_says

This function takes a string as input and performs the following operations:

1. Replaces all occurrences of the letter "y" with "i".
2. Removes all spaces.
3. Reverses the string.

The function then returns the resulting string.

Example usage:

```python
print(she_says_he_says('ma rymu'))  # Outputs: 'umiram'
```

## solfege

This function takes a string as input, which should contain a title (optional) and a hymn separated by ': '. It then partitions the hymn into a sublist starting from the first string, skipping every two other strings, and ending 3 strings from the end. The function returns the result as a string with ', ' as a separator.

The function signature is as follows:

```python
def solfege(title_hymn: str) -> str:
```
